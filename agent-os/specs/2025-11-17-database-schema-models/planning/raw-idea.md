# Raw Feature Idea

## Feature Description

Database Schema & Models - Create Supabase PostgreSQL schema for items, achievements log table, and daily baseline points. Include TypeScript types and Zod schemas.

This is for a waypoint tracking app where users can check off items and earn achievement points. The database needs to be simple and extensible for future evolution.

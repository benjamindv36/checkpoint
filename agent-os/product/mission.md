# Product Mission

## Pitch
Waypoint App is an achievement tracking tool that helps people with semantic sensitivity and anyone seeking positive motivation chart their path through life by providing a flexible, guilt-free system for marking progress through waypoints, not todos.

## Alternative names
- Pilgrim: Centers on the character, emphasizing a meaningful and purposeful journey.
- Landmark: Highlights tangible achievements and significant points along the way.
- Checkpoint: Focuses on motivation and progress, providing a sense of accomplishment.
- Voyage: Emphasizes the overall journey and exploration.

## Users

### Primary Customers
- **People with Semantic Sensitivity**: Particularly autistic individuals for whom traditional todo apps trigger negative emotional responses due to semantic framing ("todo" implies obligation and failure)
- **Positive Motivation Seekers**: Anyone who finds traditional productivity tools guilt-inducing and wants a system focused on celebrating achievements rather than highlighting failures
- **Flexible Planners**: People who want to plan sometimes but not be locked into rigid systems, or who prefer to log achievements after-the-fact

### User Personas

**Alex** (25-45, Autistic Adult)
- **Role:** Knowledge worker, creative professional, or student
- **Context:** Struggles with traditional productivity tools that make them feel guilty about unfinished tasks. The word "todo" itself creates anxiety. Needs flexibility to track both planned and spontaneous achievements.
- **Pain Points:** Standard todo apps pile up incomplete items, creating shame spirals. Rigid planning systems don't account for variable energy levels. External standards feel arbitrary and demotivating.
- **Goals:** Track progress without guilt. Celebrate what gets done rather than mourn what doesn't. Have flexibility to plan ahead or log after-the-fact based on current capacity.

**Jordan** (30-50, Neurotypical Professional)
- **Role:** Project manager, entrepreneur, or busy parent
- **Context:** Manages multiple long-term goals alongside daily responsibilities. Tired of productivity apps that make them feel like they're always behind.
- **Pain Points:** Todo lists become overwhelming. Hard to see the bigger picture. Feels bad when plans change and tasks go incomplete. Wants motivation, not guilt.
- **Goals:** Visualize long-term direction while tracking daily steps. Feel good about progress made. Adapt plans without feeling like they've failed. Compare against personal baseline, not arbitrary targets.

## The Problem

### Productivity Tools Create Guilt, Not Motivation
Traditional todo apps frame work as obligations ("things you MUST do") and highlight failure (unchecked boxes, overdue items, growing backlogs). For people with semantic sensitivity, this framing is actively harmful. The language of "todos," "deadlines," and "incomplete tasks" triggers anxiety and shame. Even for neurotypical users, these tools often become sources of stress rather than motivation.

**Our Solution:** Reframe productivity as achievement tracking with positive-only reinforcement. Use the metaphor of a journey with waypoints instead of a checklist of obligations. Award points for what gets done (+10 just for existing each day) and never punish what doesn't. Let users define their own semantic framework through flexible item types (responsibilities, wishes, projects, interests) rather than imposing "todos."

### Planning Systems Are Too Rigid or Too Loose
Most tools force users to choose between rigid planning (strict schedules, required structures) or complete chaos (unorganized notes). People with variable capacity need flexibility - sometimes they can plan ahead, sometimes they can only log after-the-fact. Life changes, energy levels fluctuate, and priorities shift, but tools treat plan changes as failures.

**Our Solution:** Treat plans as "sketches, not promises." Users can plan ahead by mapping waypoints, use the tool purely for logging achievements, or mix both approaches. Plans can change without guilt - items can be unmarked, moved, or abandoned. The only measure of success is points earned for achievements completed, not adherence to a predetermined plan.

### One-Size-Fits-All Semantics Don't Work
Productivity tools impose their semantic framework on users: "tasks," "projects," "todos," "habits." But different people need different language. What one person calls a "chore," another might frame as a "responsibility" or "household interest." The imposed semantics often clash with how users naturally think about their work and life.

**Our Solution:** Provide a flexible supertag system that lets users define their own item types and semantic categories. Items can be created organically in the outliner or canvas, then auto-gathered on tag pages. Users own their framework, making it feel personal and natural rather than imposed.

## Differentiators

### Positive-Only Reinforcement (+0 Game)
Unlike traditional productivity tools that highlight failures through incomplete tasks and missed deadlines, Waypoint App only awards points for achievements. You get +10 points just for existing each day, +5 for completing a step, +25 for a waypoint, and +100 for a direction. There are no negative points, no penalties, no guilt. Unfinished items don't pile up to shame you - they simply remain as possible future waypoints. This creates a fundamentally different emotional relationship with productivity tracking.

### Semantic Flexibility Through User-Defined Types
Unlike tools that force you into their taxonomy (Asana's "tasks," Todoist's "todos," Notion's rigid databases), Waypoint App lets you define your own item types through a supertag system. Call them responsibilities, wishes, projects, interests, chores, or whatever resonates with you. This isn't just customization - it's ownership of the semantic framework itself, which is crucial for people with semantic sensitivity.

### Non-Obligatory Planning (Sketch, Don't Promise)
Unlike rigid planning tools (calendars, Gantt charts) that treat plan changes as failures, Waypoint App treats all plans as projections that can change. You can plan ahead by sketching waypoints, use it purely after-the-fact to log what you achieved, or mix both approaches. The app doesn't care if you planned something and didn't do it - it only celebrates what you actually accomplished. This removes the pressure of commitment while maintaining the benefits of forward-thinking.

### Journey Metaphor Over Task Lists
Unlike the endless vertical scrolling of todo apps, Waypoint App uses the metaphor of traveling with a paper map. You set a general direction (your destination), mark waypoints along the way (milestones), and define steps in between (discrete actions). Items can connect to show relationships. This spatial, journey-based mental model feels fundamentally different from the oppressive "list of things you haven't done yet" framing of traditional tools.

### Self-Comparison Baseline
Unlike apps with arbitrary productivity standards (streaks, daily goals, leaderboards), Waypoint App lets you track against your own baseline. Your daily +10 existence points establish a floor - anything beyond that is progress. You can plan by points ("I need 200 points this week to stay steady") based on your own patterns, not external expectations. This makes the tool a personal growth tracker rather than a performance measurement system.

## Key Features

### Core Features
- **Three-Level Item Hierarchy:** Organize your journey with Directions (long-term destinations, purple/bold, 100 points), Waypoints (intermediate milestones, blue, 25 points), and Steps (discrete actions, default, 5 points). This structure helps you see both the big picture and the small actions.

- **Lightning-Fast Keyboard Input:** Press `/` or `Space` to open quick-add, then use markdown-style syntax (`> Text` for Direction, `- Text` for Waypoint, plain text for Step). `Tab` to indent and create children, `Enter` for new items at the same level, `→` or `>` at the end to connect to previous items. Capture your entire waypoint structure in under 20 seconds.

- **Positive-Only Points System:** Earn +100 for completed Directions, +25 for Waypoints, +5 for Steps, and +10 just for existing each day. No negative points ever. Track your achievements and feel good about progress without guilt about what's unfinished.

### Tracking & Motivation Features
- **Achievement Log:** A sidebar that shows all completed items with timestamps and points earned. See your daily baseline points automatically added and watch your total score grow. This becomes your personal achievement journal.

- **Self-Comparison Metrics:** Track against your own baseline with automatic +10 daily points. Plan by points if desired ("I need 200 points this week") based on your own patterns, not arbitrary external standards.

- **Flexible Usage Modes:** Use the app however works for you - plan ahead by sketching waypoints, use it purely after-the-fact to log achievements, or mix both approaches. The app adapts to your capacity and style.

### Organization Features
- **Nested Outline View:** The main view showing items in a nested list structure with visual indicators for item types and connection lines showing relationships. This provides clarity about how your waypoints relate to each other and your larger directions.

- **Manual Connection System:** Connect any item to another using `→` or `>` at the end during quick-add, or through the interface. This lets you show relationships between waypoints on different branches of your journey.

- **Supertag System:** Define your own item types (responsibilities, chores, wishes, projects, interests, etc.) beyond the basic three-level hierarchy. Items tagged with a supertag are auto-gathered on tag pages, giving you flexible views without rigid categorization.

### Future Features (v2+)
- **Visual Canvas View:** Node-based visual editor using ReactFlow where you can see and manipulate your waypoint map spatially. Drag items to connect them, auto-layout for clarity, and switch between outline and canvas seamlessly.

- **Multi-Direction Support:** Track multiple long-term directions simultaneously with filtering and organization tools. See all your waypoints across different areas of life.

- **Search & Export:** Find specific waypoints quickly and export your achievement log to celebrate your journey over time.

### Future Vision (v4+)
- **Interactive Map Canvas with Fog-of-War:** Transform the abstract waypoint system into a living, explorable map. Start with your avatar at the center of a fog-covered world. As you place Directions, the fog lifts to reveal procedurally generated landscapes - mountains, cities, lakes, and other major landmarks. Adding Waypoints between "here" and "there" reveals more terrain with villages, farms, rivers, and natural features. When you define Steps between Waypoints, actual roads appear showing the concrete path forward. This visualization provides spacetime guidance for visual thinkers and creates powerful motivation through progressive revelation.

- **Missions (Side Quests):** Introduce a fourth item type for small achievements done along the journey that aren't part of the main directional path. These represent opportunities, experiments, or detours - things that add richness to your journey without being required steps toward your destination.

- **Avatar Customization:** Let users design and customize their map avatar, making the journey feel personal and embodied. The avatar serves as "you are here" on the map canvas.

- **Procedural Landscape Generation:** Use algorithms (Perlin noise, rule-based feature placement) to generate unique, aesthetically pleasing terrain for each user's journey. Landscapes can reflect themes or be customized per Direction (e.g., mountain ranges for challenging goals, peaceful meadows for creative projects).

name: Testing Test Writing
description: Write minimal, strategic tests focused on core user flows and critical paths during development, deferring edge cases and comprehensive coverage until logical completion points, with behavior-focused tests, clear test names, mocked dependencies, and fast execution. Use this skill when writing tests or test files. Use when creating unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests. Use when testing critical user workflows or business logic. Use when mocking external dependencies like databases or APIs. Use when naming test cases or organizing test suites. Use when completing features that require test coverage. Use when working in test directories or test files.

# Testing Test Writing

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle testing test writing.

## When to use this skill:

- When writing test files or test cases for any code
- When creating unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests
- When testing core user flows and critical business logic
- When mocking external dependencies like databases, APIs, or file systems
- When naming test cases with descriptive, behavior-focused names
- When organizing test suites or structuring test files
- When ensuring tests run fast (milliseconds) for quick feedback
- When reaching logical completion points that require test coverage
- When working in test directories or .test, .spec, or test files

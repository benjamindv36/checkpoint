# Global Validation

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global validation.

## When to use this skill:

- When implementing input validation or data validation in any code
- When validating form inputs, API requests, or user-submitted data
- When implementing both server-side validation and client-side validation for UX
- When sanitizing user input to prevent SQL injection, XSS, or command injection
- When validating data types, formats, ranges, or required fields
- When implementing business rule validation (e.g., sufficient balance, valid dates)
- When providing specific, actionable error messages to users
- When using allowlists to define what's permitted rather than blocklists
- Use this skill universally across all data validation and input checking scenarios
